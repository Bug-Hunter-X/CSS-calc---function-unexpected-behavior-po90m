The following CSS rule is causing unexpected behavior:

```css
div {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

The `calc()` function is used to calculate the width dynamically, but it might lead to unexpected results if the parent element doesn't have a defined width. If the parent's width is not explicitly set, it could result in the child element having a width that is less than expected.
