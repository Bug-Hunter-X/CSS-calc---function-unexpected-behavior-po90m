To fix this issue, ensure that the parent element has a defined width. You can either set a fixed width (e.g., `width: 500px;`) or use percentage-based width if you want the div to always occupy a certain percentage of the parent's width. This provides a clear reference for the `calc()` function to calculate from.

Here's how you can correct the CSS:

```css
div {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}

/*Add this*/
div.parent {
  width: 80%; /*Or a fixed width, e.g., width: 500px;*/
}

```
In this example, we added a class to the parent of the div that contains width property, this makes sure that the calc function operates on a well defined width, making sure the result is as expected.
